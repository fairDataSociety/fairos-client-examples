# fairos-websocket-client (js websocket implementation)

This directory contains examples of communicating with FairOS using websockets in JavaScript.

In the example a new websocket connection is opened and various events are sent to the FairOS server. Also there is a message handler that is executed whenever a new message is received from the server. That handler prints the response of the server to console.
